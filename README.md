# Platform Api
Platform Api is a GraphQL-based server-side application that interacts with a PostgreSQL database. This project is set up using Node.js and can be utilized as a starting point for building robust backend services.

## Environment setup

Before you begin, make sure you have Node.js(v20.10) and Yarn package manager installed on your machine. You will also need PostgreSQL installed and running locally.

Follow these steps to set up your environment:

### Database Setup

1. Set up your local PostgreSQL database.
2. Ensure that PostgreSQL is running on port `5432` (or update the `.env` file with your custom port).

### Application Setup

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project root directory in your terminal.
3. Run `yarn` to install all the necessary dependencies.
4. Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the following environment variables:

```sh
DB_NAME=bqCore
DB_PORT=5432
DB_USERNAME=postgres
DB_PASSWORD=CORE_ADMIN
JWT_SECRET=hello_beeQuant
```

Make sure to replace `CORE_ADMIN` with the actual password for your local PostgreSQL instance.

### Start Developing Work

Once the environment setup is complete, you can start the development server:

Run `yarn start` for a production server or `yarn start:dev` for a development server.
Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/graphql` in your web browser to test queries and mutations using the interactive GraphQL playground.

### Test

The project comes with pre-configured unit and end-to-end (e2e) tests. To run these tests and check code coverage, use the following commands:

```bash
# unit tests
$ yarn run test

# test coverage
$ yarn run test:cov
```

These tests are essential for ensuring your application runs correctly before deployment.


## Running public queries 
Navigate to web app: http://localhost:5173/, to create(register) users
Make sure the project is running at: http://localhost:3000/graphql
Running an example query like:

```
query GetUsers {
  getUsers {
    id
    email
  }
}
```

## To run a PostgreSQL database locally:

1. Install docker locally:https://www.docker.com/get-started
2. Pull the PostgreSQL Image:
   ```
   docker pull postgres
   ```
3. Run a PostgreSQL Container:
   ```
   docker run --name bqCore -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=CORE_ADMIN -e POSTGRES_DB=bqCore -p 5432:5432 -d postgres
   ```
4. Wait for the Container to Start and check the container's status:

   ```
   docker ps
   ```

5. Download a DBeaver: https://dbeaver.io/download/, connect your db using DBeaver by using the following config:
   ```
   Host: localhost
   Port: 5432
   Database: bqCore
   Username: postgres
   Password: CORE_ADMIN
   ```

6 (optional). Stop and remove the container: (you need to run step 3 again once you remove it):

```
docker stop bqCore
docker rm bqCore
```

## **CI/CD**
The CI/CD pipeline for platform_api is divided into three main parts:
1. Pre-commit checks
2. Continuous Integration (CI)
3. Continuous Deployment (CD)

Through these steps, every code update is automatically deployed to the development environment and made ready for testing.

### **1. pre-commit checks:** 
Pre-commit checks are triggered every time a local development task is completed and the code is committed via the command: `git commit`. This job includes code formatting and linting. In this repository, Prettier is used for code formatting, while ESLint is used for linting. Husky and lint-staged are utilized to apply code formatting and linting to files that are staged in Git (via the git add command).
Useful reference: https://prettier.io/docs/en/comparison

>   #### **A. Formating workflow(prettier)**
>   1. When a user runs a commit in the repository with git commit -m "XXX", Husky, a Git hook tool, is triggered.
>
>   2. Husky then executes the `yarn lint-staged` command, which configured in .husky/pre-commit:
>      ```
>      #!/bin/sh
>      . "$(dirname "$0")/_/husky.sh"
>
>      yarn lint-staged
>      ```
>
>   3. The `yarn lint-staged command`, as defined in package.json, targets all .ts, and .tsx files in staged file list(the file list that to be commited via the `git add` command) for Prettier checking using `./prettier/prettier-format.sh`
>      ```
>      "lint-staged": {
>         "src/**/*.{ts,tsx}": "./prettier/prettier-format.sh",
>         "test/**/*.{ts,tsx}": "./prettier/prettier-format.sh"
>      }
>      ```
>
>   4. The `prettier-format.sh` script runs ` yarn prettier --write` commands to fix the format based on the config file: `./prettier/.prettierrc`. 
>      It also adds files that have been formatted to the current dayâ€™s git commit using the git add command.
>

>   #### **B. code lint**
>   plan to use eslint as the code lint tool. and add code lint into the 'lint-staged', in order to completed the pre-commit checking. 
>   Actually, Need to more investigation on eslint. not quite familar with code lint in typescript. 
>   To-Be-Continues...
>

### **2. Continuous Integration (CI) - To be continue** 
This section does not contain actual code, but rather my personal thoughts and plans: The Continuous Integration process is composed of three main parts, which I plan to assemble within a single pipeline. If there are additional tests required in the future, we may consider using multiple pipelines to accommodate them.

>   #### **A. pipeline env-configuration**
>   GitHub Actions runners require an OS environment to run the pipeline. I am considering using ubuntu-latest with Node.js (v20.10) installed. 
>   Optionally, a Docker image could be considered to ensure consistency in the OS and software versions across development, testing, production, and the pipeline runner. 
>   However, this might lead to a decrease in pipeline execution speed (this needs to be tested to confirm)

>   #### **B. yarn install dependencies**
>   Run yarn to install all dependencies as specified in the dependencies block of package.json. 
>   (Question: When does it install devDependencies, and when does Yarn refer to the dependencies block in package.json to install the listed dependencies?)

>   #### **C. unit test**
>   So far, unit test is enough for testing stage. `yarn test`

>   #### **C. build code**
>   code build using `yarn build`


### **3. Continuous Deployment (CD)** 
This section does not contain actual code, but rather my personal thoughts and plans: The Continuous Deployement process is composed of three main parts, which I plan to assemble within a single pipeline. If there are additional stages required in the future, we may consider using multiple pipelines to accommodate them.

>   #### **A. create docker image**
>   Once the CI step is successful, dockerize the repository to create a Docker image.

>   #### **B. push to ECR with gitcommit ID as a image tag**
>   Push docker image into DEV ECR with tag. 
>   Consider to use the git commit as a alternative tag for each image. 

>   #### **C. Update ECS task definition with new image. **
>   Update ECS Task definition(TD) to deploy the image to ECS.
